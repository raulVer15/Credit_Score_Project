# Credit_Score_Project

   # Project Description
   You are employed by a multinational financial firm as a data scientist. The business has accumulated a lot of credit-related data and basic bank information over the course of a 
   year. To cut down on manual labor, the management plans to create an intelligent system that divides people into credit score brackets. Create a neural network model that can categorize    a person's credit score based on their credit-related data.

   # Requirements 
   1) Data Loading: program will read data from csv files that has 28 columns and 80,000 rows. The data can be unordered and it could contain repeated, missing, incorrect and or misleading       values.
   
   2) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
         - Dropping unnecessary columns and correcting data types.
         - Eliminate any row with any empty values in your target columns.
         - Eliminate duplicated columns if necessary.
         - Drop outliers if present.
         - Transform any columns using encoding is necessary.
   
   3) Model Implementation: The team should construct a Neural Network model, then test it, and finally tune-up the model so you select the model that generates
      the best predictions (target the model with the smallest Root Mean Square Error or RMSE).
   
   4) Grading Models will be graded among each other, this is based in how the perform against a reserved testing data set.
   
   5) Interface: A textual menu should be implemented in a way that the user could load several samples of the same data set (all data cleaning steps would be the same). During the demo          you will be ask to load several data sets with the same structure.
